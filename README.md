# Liam's Neovim Config ðŸ§™

> Archive Warning: I have officially switched to Helix as my primary editor.

---

Neovim config for writing code, taking notes & writing reports (typst), and general text editing.

The goal with this config is to be very zen/have minimal distractions. To achieve this
there is only one buffer in view at a time (IE file explorer is full screen).

Another goal is to be able to quickly move between files which is achieved via
`harpoon`, `telescope`, and `yazi`.
